# Instruction for running application :
1. Facebook login works only if we change iOS Deployment Target for 9.0 and run simulator with iOS 9.0. If we try to login on iOS 10, we are going to receive this message: "Safari could not open the page because it could not establish a secure connection to the server facebook login". As I have read it's because Apple made some changes with privacy etc. I could probably omit this issue with running application on real device and then on simulator, however I do not have actual and compatible Xcode and iPhone version at this particular moment.
2. Saving images after tapping on them does not work only for iPhone 7 simulator, I could not find an answer for that, even tried different approach with PHPhotoLibrary but with no success.
